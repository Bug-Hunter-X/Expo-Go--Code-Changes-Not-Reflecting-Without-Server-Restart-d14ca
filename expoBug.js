While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error related to the interaction between Expo Go and the development server.  After making code changes and saving them, the Expo Go app would not automatically update, even after refreshing or restarting the app.  Manually restarting the development server would eventually resolve it, but this was a time-consuming workaround that disrupted the development workflow. The error messages in the terminal were not particularly helpful, and there were no obvious errors or warnings in the console log of Expo Go.
